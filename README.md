# Sendwave-iOS
Sendwave Technical Test

## Architecture
I went for an MVVM architecture on this test. I also think it serves its purpose for the assignment 

## What can be improved

1- ␜ Caching the conversion rate and deal with the timestamp to decide whether or not we can choose perform request

2- 🎨 Design 😅

3- 📡 Network layer: because we are dealing with just one API call here, a better abstraction can be considered 

4- ⚙️ Tests: the ViewModels and all the logic around conversion and decoding could have been unit tested but it requires much more time to achieve it 😎
